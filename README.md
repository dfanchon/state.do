# [state.do](https://state.do)

Finite State Machine implementation with Durable Objects based on [xstate](https://xstate.js.org).
Use the [editor](https://stately.ai/editor) to create and export your state machine, then optionally add callback fetch URLs/inits to automate the machine events.

## API

Initialize machine:
<https://state.do/:key?{"id":"fetch","initial":"init","states":{"init":{"on":{"FETCH":"loading"}},"loading":{"callback":"https://fetcher.do/60sec/https://example.com/","on":{"4XX":"fault","5XX":"failure","*":"success"}},"failure":{"callback":"https://alarms.do/fromNow/10sec/https://state.do/:key/RETRY","on":{"RETRY":{"target":"loading"}}},"fault":{"callback":"https://example.logging.do/error?message=","type":"final"},"success":{"callback":"https://graphology.do.cf/:key?newnode?example|","type":"final"}}}>

Read current state:
<https://state.do/:key>

Send event to machine:
<https://state.do/:key/:event>
