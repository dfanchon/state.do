# [state.do](https://state.do)

Finite State Machine implementation with Durable Objects based on [xstate](https://xstate.js.org)

## API

Initialize machine:
<https://state.do/:key?{"id":"fetch","initial":"init","states":{"init":{"on":{"FETCH":"loading"}},"loading":{"callback":"https://example.com/","on":{"OK":"success","Error":"failure"}},"failure":{"callback":"https://alarms.do/fromNow/10sec/https://state.do/:key/RETRY","on":{"RETRY":{"target":"loading"}}},"success":{"callback":"https://graphology.do.cf/:key?newnode?example|","type":"final"}}}>

Read current state:
<https://state.do/:key>

Send event to machine:
<https://state.do/:key/:event>

## Example with callbacks
